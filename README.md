## Project Description
  * For this CutieHack 2021 Project, we will be encorporating the theme "Better Together" by coding the popular card game Blackjack!


 Welcome to Blackjack! The objective of this game is obtain cards that are closest to the value of 21 altogether. Go over 21 and the game is over for you! This game of luck entails two encapsulated functions: Hit and Stay. You should Hit when you're confident your total value will be under 21; you should Stay when you believe you will go over 21 on your next Hit. Ace is worth 1 OR 11 points, Royal cards are worth 10, number values 2-10 are worth their exact amount. Good luck!
